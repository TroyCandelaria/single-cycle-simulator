# single-cycle-simulator
A single cycle simulator w/ GUI built in java to demonstrate how a single cycle processor would work.
Problem 
As a programmer it is important to know how a cycle simulator works, but it is hard to to understant the single cicle processor works.
The prcess behing the single simulator is important to understand in computer architecture.
In order to understand something as a programmer you want to understand the process but also relate to the computer architecture.
therefore the students decided to create a single cycle simulator with a GUI in java which would 
demonstrate the single cycle program. Understanding a single cycle simulator will give a better understanting 
of the more complicated simulators.
Methodology 
 1. create a single simulator in java language 
 2. code the single cimulator
	a.within the code create a GUI for the following components
		-ALU Add
		-PC 
		-MUX 
		-Register
		-Sign Extender
		-data memory
		-shift left
 3. connect the components of the hald adder to the apropriate component 
Deliverables 
  our project involves coding therefore we will have a demonstration of the design during 
presentation explaining carefully the behavior of the impits ad the output of 
each gates.
